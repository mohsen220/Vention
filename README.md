# Setup
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure you have `npm` installed.

The project should open automatically in your browser at `localhost:8080`


# Assignment

Using this sample 3D project, develop a Cypress test suite to run integrated tests. The test coverage is left to your discretion. You can use the global variable `shapes` for validation. You need to provide your assignment in a form that's suitable for us to run (a Github repository, a zip file, etc.)

# Vention Takehome Exercise

## Description
This project provides a web application for managing 3D shapes within a browser. Users can add, position, and remove shapes such as spheres and cubes, modifying their attributes such as position and color dynamically through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Add Shapes**: Users can add spheres and cubes to the scene.
- **Modify Attributes**: Modify position (X, Y, Z coordinates) and color of the shapes.
- **Remove Shapes**: Ability to remove the last added shape or all shapes from the scene.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive to window size changes, ensuring consistent user experience across different device sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS** for layout and styling.
- **JavaScript** for the application logic.
- **Three.js** for rendering 3D graphics.
- **Webpack** for bundling JavaScript files.
- **Cypress** for automated testing of the application functionalities.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
