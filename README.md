# Testing Strategy Summary

Below is a table summarizing the test cases, their actions, and the expected outcomes for our application's functionality and validation testing.

## Functionality & Validation Testing
| Test Case Description                                           | Action                                                  | Expected Outcome                                                   |

| **Creating Multiple Shapes and Removing All**                   | Add multiple shapes, validate, and remove all           | Shapes added and all removed correctly, validate each shape        |
| **Adding Sphere & Cube with Negative Position Coordinates**     | Add shapes with negative coordinates, validate, and remove all | Negative coordinates handled correctly, shapes validated and removed |
| **Adding Shapes with Same & Different Dimensional Coordinates** | Add shapes at different coordinates, validate, and remove all | Validate positioning and attributes of each shape, remove all shapes correctly |
| **Adding Shapes with Different Colors**                         | Add shapes with different colors, validate, and remove one by one | Colors applied correctly, each shape validated and removed sequentially |

## UI Testing
| Test Case Description                             | Action                               | Expected Outcome                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **UI Testing - Shape Rendering**                  | Render a shape, convert canvas to image, snapshot | Correct rendering, image visible, snapshot captured |

## Error Handling
| Test Case Description                             | Action                                   | Expected Outcome                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Error Handling - Invalid Position (String)** :x:          | Add a sphere with string positions, validate | Handle invalid input gracefully, validate error or lack of shape creation |
| **Error Handling - Invalid Position (Special Characters)** :interrobang: | Add a sphere with special characters as positions, validate | Handle invalid input gracefully, validate error or lack of shape creation |

### Components

- **Route 53 DNS Zone**: Manages the domain `venti-on.com`.
- **EC2 Instance**: An instance named `MyVentionInstance` running in the `us-east-2` region.
- **Security Group**: Named `my_security_group`, allowing inbound traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 8080 (Custom).
- **Key Pair**: `VentionKey`, used for secure SSH access to the EC2 instance.
- **IAM User**: `ventionuser`, with permissions to manage the above resources.
